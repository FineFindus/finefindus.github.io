FOSS enthusiast using/working on Android and Linux projects. Member of the [GNOME Foundation](https://foundation.gnome.org). I'm currently using `Rust` often in combination with `GTK` and `libadwaita` for GNOME projects, but I also know a byte about Android development.

Feel free to contact me with any questions.
